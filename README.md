# LEEC_The_Game


#Description:
 

In the year 4000 our home solar system, the sol system was sucked into a black hole and every human that was in the sol system was killed in the event.
All that remain is a squadron of 400 people that is divided into four fleets of a hundred people. Each fleet capable of protecting itself from a moderate
attack and sustaining life for years. When the squadron received news from Mission control, it was already too late to try and evacuate humans from the sol system.
After years of searching for other survivors the entire squadron decided that it was time to move on and look at the bigger picture.
Another six years passed while working on a way to communicate long distances without the help of a relay system from the sol system.
Each of the fleets headed in a direction in hopes to find a suitable planet to colonialize.

It is the year 4400 and the future of the human race hangs on a thread.

#Game synopsis:
 
To understand the future one has to understand the past.

From the time the first rocket launched to space humanity’s new target was space. Legend has it that after the first human set foot on the moon the real race started,
a race to see who can get to the next nearest planet, that would be the start of what many have thought was the best thing that could happen, it was not long before every
planet in the sol system was visited. Governments focused all their attention on getting to the next planet and did not consider the fact that the earth is getting over
populated, but it was not until there was no more green left on the planet that governments realized that if no action is taken humanity would suffer a disastrous fate.
After months of meetings held by all governments decision was made that they should all work together and start living on the nearest planet which at the time was a planet
called mars. All governments worked together and a company called “Earth expansion corporation was formed” EEC for short, Plans for a new ship design went underway and the
very first of many colonizer was build. After the colonization of mars came space ports which would be the start of the first of many programs to find suitable planets to 
sustain the human raise. Some was constructed at nearby solar systems like the Rigil Kentaurus (also known as Alpha Centauri), a Canis Majored (also known as Sirius),etc.
the others was send to other galaxies, like the Canis Major Dwarf, Phoenix Dwarf, Ursa Major II Dwarf, Fornax Dwarf, etc. The Phoenix Dwarf in particular is home to the EEC
Enterprise the first of the many “Lyden Earth Expantion Corporation Space Station“(LEECSS for short, Pronounced Leecs).

Years went by and as the population on mars grew interplanetary trade increased and the EEC established an interplanetary stock exchange, but later changed to intergalactic
stock exchange (IGSE for short) due to the fact that massive amounts of resources are being traded by LEECSS in the other galaxies. later on the EEC started researching new
technology to transform a planet to support human life, but it was not until a teenager accidently discovered a new source of power which would in turn be strong enough to
power the previous ideas deemed impossible to transform a planet, thus terraforming was born and colonization of all the other planets in the sol system. Ultimately throwing
the whole sol system of balance something which the scientists did not know would happen, the sun collapsed creating what is known as a Black hole and turning the whole sol
system into what we now call the “Sol Black Hole” SBH for short. In that catastrophic event all communications to the remaining LEECSS was lost.

Engineers later established communication to other LEECSS. During the past twenty years most of the other LEECSS have been terribly damaged in the search for a habitable
planet because the technology to transform planets was lost when our home got sucked into a black hole.

Twenty four hours ago we received a message from the EEC Philadelphia stating they found a planet with intelligent life and is being approached by an unknown Spaceship.
All communication with the EEC Philadelphia has been lost since. We now fear that the humans are not the only intelligent life out here in the universe. It is now up to
us to reestablish humanity in this universe and save what is left of humanity. 

It is now up to you commander, the fate of the EEC Enterprise and humanity rest in your hands, good luck.
